## About this project

The *IPv6 Web Resource Chceker (webres6)* is a small tool/api to checks IPv6-only readiness of a Web page or app.
It loads a given URL using Selenium and displays the IP addresses and protocols of all hosts it fetches resources from and comes with a CLI and Web client.

The tool is inspired by Paul Marks' [IPvFoo](https://github.com/pmarks-net/ipvfoo) browser extension. While *IPvFoo* is more flexible and interactive, *Webres6* can be run as a service and allows IPv6-only testing without installation or IPv6 on the users' client as well as automated analysis.

### Features

- Fetches a web site/app using Selenium and extracts host names and IP addresses from the performance log.
- Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for all hosts used and whether the website is ready for IPv6-only clients.
- Can take screenshots from the pages crawled for debugging purpose.
- Can add WHOIS data to provide a hint about the infrastructure behind the resources.
- Can load Chrome extensions to manage cookie consent
- Can handle NAT64 on the API server side.
- Exports data using a REST API as JSON for further analysis.

The tool can be accessed using a [CLI Client](#cli) and a built-in [Web app](#web-app).

### Known limitations

Only works if Selenium is running on a dual-stack hosts (or on an IPv6-only host with NAT64).
  - If the host is IPv4-only, everything will be reported in red even if the web sites are IPv6 ready â€“ This limitation is going to stay.
  - If the host is IPv6-only without NAT64, all IPv4-only resources are missed out. 

No auto-detection of NAT64 prefixes - prefixes other than the well-known prefix `64:ff9b::/96` need to be statically configured.

The Selenium automation is quite simple and just loads the URL. 
As modern Web pages tend to be complex, this will most likely result in many resources not getting loaded/analyzed a normal browser would load.
 - No efforts are taken to hide this being a robot
 - No delayed on-scroll content loading takes place
 - Limited Cookie consent interactions are supported through plugins -  use an extension like consent-o-matic for that.
 - Because we don't have long-term cooke state, we [expect that some advertisements and analytics may not be loaded](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.11947).
 - No authentication/login takes place

## Requirements 

### API server (webres6-api)
<a id="api"/>

- Python 3.7+  
- Flask 3.1.2+
- Selenium 4.33+ with [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and Python support
- A dual-stack or IPv6-only host with NAT64 connectivity to run Selenium on

### CLI Client
<a id="cli"/>

- Python 3.7+  
- URLib3 2.5.0+ with URLlib3-future 2.13.906+

### Web App 

- jquery-3.7.1
- 72 web font

## Setup (development):

First, you need to have Selenium installed or 
available as a service and have ```SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL``` environment variable pointing to it.

Run the following script to build virtualenvs for API and CLI: ```bash create-virtualenvs.sh ```

The *api* and *cli* code can be found in the respective folders.
Don't forget to run ```bash source .venv/bin/activate``` within the respective folder before trying to execute the python code.

## Setup (docker compose):

```bash docker-compose build``` should build the containers for the APi server and an NGNIX container serving the Web app.

```bash docker-compose up``` launches a demo environment with Selenium deployed in a separate docker container. Please note that this only works properly if your docker setup supports IPv6, which is still challenging (especially on MacOS).

## Setup (kubernetes):

There is a helm chart available in the `helm` directory with a deployment example in the `deploy` folder.

## Usage

### API server 

```bash
# Start web service
./webres6-server.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help                  Show this help message and exit
  --port PORT                 Port to listen on (default: 6400)
  --debug                     Enable debugging output

Environment variables:
  SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL         Use remote Selenium server instead of starting selenium for each request
  NAT64_PREFIXES              Comma-separated list of NAT64 prefixes
  ADMIN_API_KEY               API Key to call privileged functions
  TIMEOUT                     Maximum timeout value in seconds
  ENABLE_WHOIS                Enable clients to request whois lookups
  WHOIS_TTL                   Expiry time for internal whois cache

API endpoints:
  /ping                       liveness probe endpoint
  /favicon.EXT                send favicon
  /res6/$metadata             get OData metadata document
  /res6/srvconfig             list available extensions, screenshot-modes, whois support, ...
  /res6/url(URL)              get JSON results for URL provided
  /metrics                    Prometheus compatible metrics
  /adm/whois/expire           expire old whois cache entries (requires ADMIN_API_KEY if set)
  /[#URL]                     Web app to initiate analysis and display results
```

### CLI Client

```bash
./webres6-cli.py [options] URL

Options:
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit
      --api API             Base API endpoint overriding WEBRES6_API_URL env
      --srvconfig           Show server configuration - incl. supported extensions and screenshot modes - and exit
